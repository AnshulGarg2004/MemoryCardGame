Memory Match Game
=================

Overview
--------
The Memory Match Game is a fun and interactive card-flipping game where the goal 
is to test and improve your memory. Players must find matching pairs of cards 
within the grid. The game tracks moves, time, and allows you to select different 
difficulty levels and themes.

This project is built using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — no frameworks required. 
It is lightweight, responsive, and works on both desktop and mobile devices.
